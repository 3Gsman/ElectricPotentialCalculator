 Welcome to the Electric Charge Calculator:
 This program basically allowes the user to add charges to a graph in order 
 to calculate the electric potential on the desired point.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In order to do so, we have a couple tools that will help us throughout our
 way, but first lets explain how does the main frame work.
 On the top left corner of the frame we have a menubar in which we have 
 two options: File and tools.
 Then we have our graph that will constantly remain visible for the user 
 to keep track on the charges that will be added to the graph.

 After going through a quick review of the main frame, lets explain how 
 to use the tools we mentioned before.
 First, we are going to introduce the "File" features:

 1.- New charge: the "New charge" button will display a window in which 
     the user is able to add charges by introducing their "X" and "Y" 
     position and their value (you can choose between positive, "+"
     and negative "-")
 2.- Load: the "Load" button will display a file chooser window in which
     the user is able to select a preloaded file with some charges or 
     just load one of the previous files he has saved.
 3.- Save: the "Save" button it´s basically a feature of the program that
     allowes the user to save his files in order to load them later.

 Finally, we will explain the "Tools" features:

 1.- Calculate: the "Calculate" button shows a frame in which the user is 
     able to calculate the electric potential. To do that the user is
     asked to fill in 2 blanks; the "X position" blank and the "Y position"
     blank. This will be the exact position where the electric potential
     of the charges that are currently displayed on the graph will be 
     calculated.
 2.- Help: the "Help" button shows the window you are currently looking at.
     (Cmon u should know that... haha)
 3.- Zoom: Finally the last feature this program offers is an option to change
     the graph´s scale by zooming in and out. The user can do that by clicking
     the "Zoom in" or "Zoom out" that are found on the Tools menu.
     (Since the 0.3 version you are also able to zoom in and out by using the 
      mouse wheel).

 Thanks for reading the Electric Charge Calculator´s user manual, if you find
 any bugs or you have any ideas that could improve the program please contact
 the development staff.
